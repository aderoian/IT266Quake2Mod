# Lethal Quake

This mod brings some features from Lethal Company into Quake 2.

## Objective
Explore the different maps, finding rare items along the way. These items must be collected (by colliding) and brought back to the staging area to be sold (area at spawn, press 'X' to drop). Each item is worth something different, and you must save up currency to buy tools to assist your adventure.

### Tools.
1. Backpack (press '1' to buy) - allows you to carry up to 10 items, better than the starting 3 inventory slots.
2. Flashlight (press '2' to buy) - lights up your surrounding area ('f' to toggle), uses energy.
3. Battery (press '3' to buy) - Gives you energy, which is used by the flashlight and stun tools.
4. Noise Maker (press '4' to buy) - Shoots a noise making projectile which distracts nearby monsters (press '6' to toggle launcher, '5' to return to blaster).
5. Stun Gun - Shoots an electric projectile from the blaster (right-click), stuns the first enemy it hits, uses energy.

## Installation
1. Download the 2 files, `gamex86.dll` and `config.cfg` from releases.
2. Navigate to the Quake2 installation folder, and create a new child folder called `lethal_quake`.
3. Copy the 2 downloaded files into this new directory.
4. Launch quake, open the terminal using '\`' (tilde), and run `set game lethal_quake`.
5. Start a new game and enjoy!
